# Project Overview

## Description

​		The goal of this project is to create a stand alone engine for experiencing old Choose Your Own Adventure style books as though they are a text adventure game played on an older terminal style computer. If you're wondering why I'm doing this, I just thought it would be cool. And I'm right.

## Current Features

- Book loading and parsing
- Terminal interaction
- Style-able text
- 
- [TODO, finish this list]

## Planned features

- Pop-out note tracker
- Imbedded note tracker?
- Load custom books after building the program
- Custom Style packs
  - Stored in the books meta-data pages
- A better experience for creating new books
  - There may be an external tool for this, it is just a JSON file after all

# How to Build a local version

## Pre-Requisites

- Git bash
- Electron

## Steps

​		Once you have those just open a git window in the download directory and run the command 'npm run start'. This Will open a new chromium window with the game ready to play.
