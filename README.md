# Project Overview

## Description

​		The goal of this project is to create a stand alone engine for experiencing old Choose Your Own Adventure style books as though they are a text adventure game played on an older terminal style computer. If you're wondering why I'm doing this, I just thought it would be cool. And I'm right.

## Current Features

- Book loading and parsing
- Terminal interaction
- Book-specific Custom Style packs
- A Collapsible Notes Section
- [TODO, finish this list]

## Planned features

- Tab-completion in the terminal interface
- A way to save the current notes
- A write-up on how to build custom books
- A better experience for creating new books
  - There may be an external tool for this, it is just a JSON file after all

# How to Build a local version

## Pre-Requisites

- [Git bash](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
- [NodeJS 14.x or higher](https://github.com/nodejs/Release)
- [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/)

## Steps

​		Once you have those just open a git window in the download directory and run the command 'npm run start'. This Will open a new chromium window with the game ready to play. For the most up-to-date version check-out the dev branch, for a more stable experience download the main branch.
